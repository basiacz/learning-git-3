      <p>And now, the end is near 
      And so I face the final curtain 
      My friend, I'll say it clear 
      I'll state my case, of which I'm certain 
      I've lived a life that's full 
      I've traveled each and every highway 
      And more, much more than this 
      I did it my way</p>
      <p>Regrets, I've had a few 
      But then again, too few to mention 
      I did what I had to do 
      And saw it through without exemption 
      I planned each charted course 
      Each careful step along the byway 
      And more, much more than this 
      I did it my way</p>
